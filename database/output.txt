Keep related supplies in the same area.,
Make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session.,
Place loose supplies in large, clearly visible containers.,
Use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches, photos, and reference material.,
Use every inch of the room for storage, especially vertical space.,
Use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls.,
Purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi-permanent.,
Make a habit of throwing out old, excess, or useless stuff each month.",How to Be an Organized Artist1," If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio. Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:


Essential supplies area -- the things you use every day.
Inspiration and reference area.
Dedicated work area .
Infrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;
, This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.


Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.

, As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:


Canvas shoe racks on the back of the door
Wine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.
Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.

, A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.


Don't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.

Create a sketch in the NeoPopRealist manner of the future mural on a small piece of paper 8""x10"" using the black ink pen.,
Prepare to create your NeoPopRealist mural.,
Prepare your paint.,
Begin your project with a design.,
Produce a scaled down version of your finished mural.,
Prepare the wall to be painted.,
After you have primed the surface, measure the wall.,
Paint in the base coat of the background.,
Allow the background and base coats to dry.,
Draw the lines, then fill the appeared section with different repetitive patterns (examine the images above).,
Paint patterns with brushes of suitable size for the particular portion of work you are painting.,
Clean up the lines and shapes as needed.,
Seal the mural if needed.,
Be inspired and it will help you succeed!",How to Create a Neopoprealist Art Work," See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step. However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.


Use the lines to create the image shape and sections.
Fill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.
Add text if needed, for example ""NeoPopRealism is 25!""
Add a colored strip on the top, any color you wish.;
, Painting a mural always requires some preparation. Youâ€˜ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.

This surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.

, For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.

Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.
Paints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.

, See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements., Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color., If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold., Mark the horizontal and vertical lines., Use white paint as background., Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand., Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing., An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns., If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location. Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred., If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer., However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling. But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books. Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.
